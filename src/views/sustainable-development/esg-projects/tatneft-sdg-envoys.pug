						p The global community is facing a series of simultaneous crises that threaten the very survival of humankind. All of these crises — and ways to prevent and overcome them — are being dealt with comprehensively in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
						p The SDGs are a set of 17 interrelated goals developed by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly as a “blueprint for achieving a better and more sustainable future for all”. They include all the elements for the prosperous existence of humanity on the planet now and in the future. That is why their realization is important to each of us and everyone should know of these goals.
						p Starting from 2020, TATNEFT Company has been running the project TATNEFT's SDG Envoys aimed at shaping the worldview of mindful behavior (rationality, frugality, awareness), development of energy efficiency and energy saving culture.

						ul 
							li environmental education of students,
							li instilling in the residents of the Republic of Tatarstan a mindful nature and environmental protection behavior.
