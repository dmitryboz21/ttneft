						p TATNEFT is working on the Green Office project. This is part of TATNEFT's wide environmental activities and a significant component of a comprehensive program aimed at cultivating responsible behavior of TATNEFT employees. Participating in the project, oil workers realize that this is not about being trendy, but about continuing “green” initiatives that have been implemented for decades. 
						p Boxes for separate collection of plastic, paper and unsorted waste have been set up as part of the project, paper consumption in offices has been reduced, and more plants can now be found in the premises.
						p Now, the Company's employees not only pay attention to the separate waste, but also form a similar behavior model among their loved ones, relatives and friends – this is a way of contributing to nature conservation that everyone can do.
						p Oil workers have reduced the use of paper in offices as a means of responsible consumption, saving money and reducing the environmental impact.
						p For example, in April 2020, the Company's management proposed to reduce the purchase of this material by 30%. This was possible due to an earlier decision to significantly reduce paper document circulation, digitalize work within the Company and slowly move to a fully electronic format of document circulation.
						p We can already see that paper waste creation has decreased by 40%. Apart from saving money used for waste disposal and the purchase of ink for printers, the document processing process has been sped up, and correspondence, including correspondence to partners and customers, is now much faster.

							b As part of the EGS agenda development, two Tatneft offices in Almetyevsk underwent an inspection for the Green Office VCS. 
						p The facilities meet the sustainability (“green” construction and operation standards) requirements for office space/buildings and meet the certification level:
						ul 
							li facility at 75 Lenina Street corresponds to the level of the “Standard” certificate. 
							li facility at 75 Lenina Street corresponds to the level of the “Silver” certificate.
						p “Green office” not only helps to reduce carbon intensity, but also improves energy efficiency. Meanwhile, every employee can contribute to the creation of a comfortable working environment.
						p 
							b PJSC TATNEFT also won the Green Office Awards in the main category “Best Green Office 2022”.
