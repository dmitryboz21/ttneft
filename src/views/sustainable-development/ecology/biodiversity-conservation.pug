						p One of the priorities in the field of sustainable development of the Company is to minimize its impact on the environment.  
						p The Company reduces the man-caused impact on the natural environment of ecosystems and maintains favorable living conditions in the areas of its operations, improving environmental performance, and takes measures to restore the ecosystem to the level of self-healing potential, including the protection and conservation of biodiversity.
						p The Company has undertaken the following commitments in the field of biodiversity conservation:
						ul 
							li reducing the significant impact of the Company's activities, products and services on the biodiversity of protected natural areas and areas with high biodiversity value outside the boundaries of protected natural areas
							li conservation and restoration of biodiversity, habitats, animal migration routes and compensation for possible environmental damage
							li reduction and prevention of fragmentation of natural landscapes, reduction of disturbed territories
							li minimization of operations on specially protected natural territories and in their protected areas, on World Natural Heritage sites
						p 
							b Regulatory internal documents:
						ul 
							li Policy on Sustainable Development and Engagement with Stakeholders 
							li Health, Safety and Environmental Policy of PJSC TATNEFT named after V.D. Shashin with considerations to climate change
							li Standard on Management of Protection of Land and Forest Resources, Biodiversity, Specially Protected Natural Areas (specially protected natural areas)
							li Regulations on the protection and rational use of land and forest resources
						p The Company treats any natural territories in the locations of its presence as protected and annually enhances its efforts on biodiversity conservation.
						p The Company implements the Biodiversity Preservation Program. The purpose of the Biodiversity Conservation Program is to preserve the diversity of natural biosystems in the territories of operations at a level that ensures their sustainable existence and sustainable use. To achieve this goal, a set of measures has been developed, which is an integral part of the Environmental Program.
						p 
							b Environmental aspect identification system 
						p The integrated management system of the Company provides for a system of identification of environmental aspects, which allows to identify areas of impact on biodiversity that need to be controlled or improved, as well as to set priorities.
						p The results of hazard identification and risk assessment of the environmental aspects of the Company are the initial data for the development of measures for the conservation of biodiversity and the formation of appropriate programs.
						p The Company's main impacts on biodiversity:
						ul 
							li oppression of flora and fauna due to continuous air pollution, physical exposure
							li impact on immobile groups of living organisms during the construction of oil facilities
							li fragmentation of landscapes, due to the construction of a road network, pipelines
							li death of micro- and mesofauna, flora, soil degradation as a result of accidental oil spills on the terrain
						p The main objects of the Biodiversity Conservation Program are:
						ul 
							li specially protected natural areas
							li species and populations of the animal world subject to special protection and their habitats
							li vulnerable ecosystems (estuaries, swamps, tundra, etc.)
						p In the course of production activities, the Company has no irreversible impact on biodiversity.

						h2 SPECIALLY PROTECTED NATURAL AREAS
						p The core activity of the Company is focused in the south-east of the Republic of Tatarstan, which is densely populated, developed in agriculture and experiences a high anthropogenic load. 
						p There are 35 specially protected natural territories in the region of the Company's production activity. The largest specially protected natural area of federal significance is the Nizhnyaya Kama National Park. 
						p This is a unique natural complex of forests and meadows of the north-east of Tatarstan with an area of 26,460 hectares, located in the center of the Nizhnekamsk territorial production complex. The Company carries out industrial ecological control of the flora (phytomonitoring) on the territory of the Nizhnyaya Kama National Park.
						p According to the results of monitoring studies, the operation of the Company's oilfield facilities in 2022 did not result in a deterioration of the ecosystems of the adjacent territory, and did not violate the park's protection regime. Industrial environmental control is carried out by the Company in the territories of the developed fields located in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug.
						p Due to the special vulnerability of natural tundra complexes, the control program has been expanded and includes an assessment of the species and quantitative composition of vegetation cover, soil mesofauna and soil mammals, mosses, wildlife, benthos. The monitoring results show that the operation area is not subject to significant anthropogenic impact.
						h2 SPECIES AND POPULATIONS OF THE ANIMAL WORLD SUBJECT TO SPECIAL PROTECTION 
						p 18 bird species and 4 fish species listed in the Red Book of the Russian Federation, 2 mammal species listed in the Red Book of the Russian Federation and the Red Book of the Republic of Tatarstan - the bobac and the desman, which are also in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, inhabit the territory of the TATNEFT Group operations.
						p The location of production facilities outside the territories of the habitat of rare animal species, the implementation of environmental protection measures can reduce the adverse impact on the environment and prevent the disappearance of rare animal species by supporting existing specially protected natural areas. The Company, together with Ak Bars Hockey Club, continues to support the restoration and increase of the population of the "red book" snow leopard.
						p Sailugemsky National Park in Altai is the only place in Russia where the symbols of Tatarstan — snow leopards - live. Installed camera traps help to record the habits of the predators, their movements and the appearance of new individuals, and anti-poaching raids have reduced the occurrence of illegal hunting. 
						p Educational and PR events aimed at increasing the awareness of the program and the level of environmental responsibility have been implemented jointly with the Sailyugemsky National Park.
						p A children's book "The Mystery of the Missing Stick" has been published, where a separate chapter is devoted to the rescue of snow leopards in the Altai. The work has an important disciplinary and educational value, 10,000 copies of the book were donated to the children of the Company's employees. 
						p In 2023, information cooperation and participation in anti-poaching raids in the Altai Territory of the Saylyugemsky National Park will continue, as well as charity matches of  Ak Bars Hockey Club in support of the conservation of the snow leopard population.
					.dmpage-quote Since 2021, the Company has been providing voluntary insurance of environmental risks of a hazardous production facility - the oil treatment and pumping unit of NGDU Prikamneft, which is the closest to the Nizhnyaya Kama National Park and the Kama River.
